<h1>Project Structure</h1>

The top level directory for this project is called: Russel-Hospital-Senior-Design
	-For simplicities sake, let's make this the only directory with capital letters.
	-All sub-directories should be lowercase to keep our file paths simple.
	-Let's give all sub-directories a descriptive name, with words separated by '-'.
		-Example: /database-files

I propose that we organize our project into four main sub-directories
<ul>
	<li>For the web front and backend components:  /server-files</li>
	<li>For the controller python/bacPypes code:   /controller-files</li>
	<li>For our database files: 				    /database-files</li>
	<li>For our documentation:        				/documentation</li>
</ul>
